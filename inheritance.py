# Inheritance

'''
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. 
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Classes can inherit one or more classes

# Single Inheritance

# NOTE:
'''
In languages that use multiple inheritance, the order in which base classes are searched when looking for a method is 
often called the Method Resolution Order, or MRO.
